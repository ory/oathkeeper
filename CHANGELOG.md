# Unreleased (2020-05-07)

No significant changes have been made for this release.


# [0.38.0-beta.1](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/compare/v0.37.1-beta.1...v0.38.0-beta.1) (2020-05-07)


### Bug Fixes

* Add old schemas to resolve issues with old versions ([b94c391](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/b94c391446a694971fa54a53eb08f9d57ad5eb24)), closes [#400](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/400)
* Don't copy the decision endpoint request's Content-Length ([#422](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/422)) ([0e99045](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/0e990459104c7683764f4ed0e0a6b7162b57cd57)):
  > We currently copy all original request headers send to the decission
  > endpoint back. This can include the Content-Length header which
  > describes the request body or response. Including the original
  > request Content-Length causes issues for the decission endpoint
  > client if the response body doesn't match the exact size.
  > 
  > This change makes sure the Content-Length doesn't get included in
  > the response body and adds a test to prevent future regressions.
* Respect retry in token introspection ([#410](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/410)) ([88f7b69](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/88f7b69c9ff252ddc3dbe960155883ec98115fd0))
* Use pipe to pass body remote authorizer ([#426](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/426)) ([1a44087](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/1a44087f424d8a01437769c6bce177eab36c195f)):
  > Resolves flaky tests.
* Use semver-regex replacer func ([a13cdf5](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/a13cdf5d9a518e3095545e30d15c7c4b7859752b))


### Code Refactoring

* Updates issue and pull request templates ([#393](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/393)) ([a4ade5c](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/a4ade5ca29a9ce24a3ffb6c9705c4723e67f9619))

### Features

* Add cache to hydrator ([#418](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/418)) ([1ae6e7a](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/1ae6e7a958d602533f54cada5d231bcf1bace093)), closes [#417](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/417):
  > This patch introduces new configuration parameters that allow the hydrator mutator to cache requests.
* Add new remote authorizer that uses request body and headers ([#416](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/416)) ([3a20637](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/3a206376c0ec4d72d5d6ec66c2d738199a24e0c6)):
  > This pull request implements a new authorizer that sends the original request body as body to the remote endpoint. This allows the remote endpoint to take the body into account in its decision.
  > 
  > The current remote_json authorizer does not have the ability to send
  > the request body of the request to authorize. This means this cannot
  > be taken into account while checking permissions.
  > 
  > Providing the request body as part of the JSON payload won't always
  > work as JSON cannot handle binary data.
* Add prometheus docs ([#427](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/427)) ([117ee6a](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/117ee6a4c53035651f41a5bb4a9afe3c8b0c7438))
* Add prometheus endpoint providing basic request metrics ([#404](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/404)) ([fdaed46](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/fdaed46bcffbbdf593e94bc1784df88809e63fcd)):
  > This patch adds basic prometheus metrics. The prometheus metrics are exposed at the default prometheus exporter port 9000 and is configurable with:
  > 
  > ```
  >  serve:
  >    prometheus:
  >      port: 9000
  >      host: localhost
  >      metrics_path: /metrics
  > ```
* Oauth2_introspect cache introspection results ([#424](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/424)) ([d4557ae](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/d4557aeac69e84d36dfc2a1ab97c61188c93457f)), closes [#293](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/293)

### Bug Fixes

* Add rule id to malformed configuration log error ([#386](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/386)) ([7688a8d](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/7688a8dc4dc0ebd5bd173d77bc7cd8cacc8e50e2))
* Disable test that fails with low cache hit rate ([#372](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/372)) ([5414dda](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/5414ddadb0b210d3a90b69183449ba7d5723ba6c)), closes [#371](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/371)
* Improve id_token performance with caching ([#367](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/367)) ([47e9fee](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/47e9feefcea2d3508932ef3b323709b0bfa0d707)), closes [#364](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/364)
* Load config file only in serve command ([#365](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/365)) ([68c8546](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/68c85469b4523e5accf3de8e97b97b87416875d3))

* SendOAuth2 introspection scope only when strategy is none ([#379](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/379)) ([5e0c8dc](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/5e0c8dcdc4a64662f59372a488ec633bcdbc0d85)), closes [#377](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/issues/377):
  > This patch removes the `scope` key from the OAuth2 Introspection request body when a scope strategy other than `none` is set for the OAuth2 Introspection handler. If the scope strategy is `none`, the `scope` key is included in the body.

  > Oathkeeper has gone through a couple of changes since the initial draft of the
  > docker compose file, considering these changes and the newly introduced
  > Dockerfile in the previous commit, make these changes to the docker-compose.yml:
  > 1. Bump the version of the compose file to 3.
  > 2. Remove the need for the postgres database app, since Oathkeeper no longer needs a
  > database.
  > 3. Remove the need for the migration app, since we no longer need to migrate since
  > there is no database and the option is deprecated.
  > 4. Use the newly defined Dockerfile 'Dockerfile-dc'.
  > 5. We now serve both API and PROXY from the same app, so we don't need two
  > instances of the app.
  > 6. Add sample config, rules and JWK files to `.docker_compose`, mount this via a
  > volume mount.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* This feature allows to use the regex capture groups from the URL matcher to be used in several places, including the ID Token generator and elsewhere. To get this working, existing `keto_engine_acp_ory` authorizers are no longer able to use regex substition in the form of `my:action:$1` but instead must use the new format which is `{{ printIndex .MatchContext.RegexpCaptureGroups 0}}` (notice that the index changed by *-1*). A rule migrator exists which makes old rules compatible with the new format, if a version string is given. More details on the rule migration can be found here: https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/pull/358/commits/fd16ceb230a1b14ebb01a147d2d70acce77f9fbd#diff-6177fb19f1b7d7bc392f5062b838df15

  > Previously, MIME matching respected the request's wildcards which lead to multiple handlers feeling responsible for a particular request. Now, wildcards coming from the HTTP Request itself are interpreted literally.
  > 
  > Additionally, ORY Oathkeeper respected the X-Forwarded-For HTTP Header for matching remote IP addresses. This behavior is now turned off by default because clients were able to fake this header otherwise. It can explicitly be turned on by setting `config.when.#.request.remote_ip.RespectForwardedForHeader: true`.

  > This patch adds a new feature called error handlers. It allows to define the error handling logic globally and per rule. It is now possible, for example, to return a JSON response for `Accept: application/json` requests and a HTTP Redirect response for requests that are coming from a user.

  > This patch adds endpoint `/judge` to `oathkeeper serve api`. The `/judge` endpoint mimics the behavior of `oathkeeper serve proxy` but instead of forwarding the request to the upstream server, the endpoint answers directly with a HTTP response.
  > 
  > The HTTP response returns status code 200 if the request should be allowed and any other status code (e.g. 401, 403) if not.
  > 
  > Assuming you are making the following request:
  > 
  > ```
  > PUT /judge/my-service/whatever HTTP/1.1
  > Host: oathkeeper-api:4456
  > User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
  > Authorization: bearer some-token
  > Accept: */*
  > Content-Type: application/json
  > Content-Length: 0
  > ```
  > 
  > And you have a rule which allows token `some-bearer` to access `PUT /my-service/whatever` and you have a credentials issuer which does not modify the Authorization header, the response will be:
  > 
  > ```
  > HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  > Authorization: bearer-sometoken
  > Content-Length: 0
  > Connection: Closed
  > ```
  > 
  > If the rule denies the request, the response will be, for example:
  > 
  > ```
  > HTTP/1.1 401 OK
  > Content-Length: 0
  > Connection: Closed
  > ```
