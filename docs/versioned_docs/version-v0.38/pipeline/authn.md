title: Authenticators
---

An authenticator is responsible for authenticating request credentials. ORY
Oathkeeper supports different authenticators and we will add more as the project
progresses.

An authenticator inspects the HTTP request (e.g. the HTTP Authorization Header)
and executes some business logic that returns true (for authentication ok) or
false (for authentication invalid) as well as a subject ("user"). The subject is
typically the "user" that made the request, but it could also be a machine (if
you have machine-2-machine interaction) or something different.

Each authenticator has two keys:

- `handler` (string, required): Defines the handler (e.g. `noop`) to be used.
- `config` (object, optional): Configures the handler. Configuration keys vary
  per handler. The configuration can be defined in the global configuration
  file, or per access rule.

**Example**

```json
{
  "authenticators": [
    {
      "handler": "noop",
      "config": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

You can define more than one authenticator in the Access Rule. The first
authenticator that is able to handle the credentials will be consulted and other
authenticators will be ignored:

```json
{
  "authenticators": [
    {
      "handler": "a"
    },
    {
      "handler": "b"
    },
    {
      "handler": "c"
    }
  ]
}
```

If handler `a` is able to handle the provided credentials, then handler `b` and
`c` will be ignored. If handler `a` can not handle the provided credentials but
handler `b` can, then handler `a` and `c` will be ignored. Handling the provided
credentials means that the authenticator knows how to handle, for example, the
`Authorization: basic` header. It does not mean that the credentials are valid!
If a handler encounters invalid credentials, then other handlers will be ignored
too.

## `noop`

The `noop` handler tells ORY Oathkeeper to bypass authentication, authorization,
and mutation. This implies that no authorization will be executed and no
credentials will be issued. It's basically a pass-all authenticator that allows
any request to be forwarded to the upstream URL.

> Using this handler is basically an allow-all configuration. It makes sense
> when the upstream handles access control itself or does not need any type of
> access control.

### Configuration

This handler is not configurable.

To enable this handler, set:

```yaml
# Global configuration file oathkeeper.yml
authenticators:
  noop:
    # Set enabled to true if the authenticator should be enabled and false to disable the authenticator. Defaults to false.
    enabled: true
```

### Access Rule Example

```sh
$ cat ./rules.json

[{
  "id": "some-id",
  "upstream": {
    "url": "http://my-backend-service"
  },
  "match": {
    "url": "http://my-app/some-route",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ]
  },
  "authenticators": [{
    "handler": "noop"
  }]
}]

$ curl -X GET http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 200 Status OK
The request has been allowed!
```

## `unauthorized`

The `unauthorized` handler tells ORY Oathkeeper to reject all requests as
unauthorized.

### Configuration

This handler is not configurable.

To enable this handler, set:

```yaml
# Global configuration file oathkeeper.yml
unauthorized:
  noop:
    # Set enabled to true if the authenticator should be enabled and false to disable the authenticator. Defaults to false.
    enabled: true
```

### Access Rule Example

```sh
$ cat ./rules.json

[{
  "id": "some-id",
  "upstream": {
    "url": "http://my-backend-service"
  },
  "match": {
    "url": "http://my-app/some-route",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ]
  },
  "authenticators": [{
    "handler": "unauthorized"
  }]
}]

$ curl -X GET http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
```

## `anonymous`

The `anonymous` authenticator checks whether or not an `Authorization` header is
set. If not, it will set the subject to `anonymous`.

### Configuration

- `subject` (string, optional) - Sets the anonymous username. Defaults to
  "anonymous". Common names include "guest", "anon", "anonymous", "unknown".

```yaml
# Global configuration file oathkeeper.yml
authenticators:
  anonymous:
    # Set enabled to true if the authenticator should be enabled and false to disable the authenticator. Defaults to false.
    enabled: true

    config:
      subject: guest
```

```yaml
# Some Access Rule: access-rule-1.yaml
id: access-rule-1
# match: ...
# upstream: ...
authenticators:
  - handler: anonymous
    config:
      subject: guest
```

### Access Rule Example

The following rule allows all requests to `GET http://my-app/some-route` and
sets the subject name to the anonymous username, as long as no `Authorization`
header is set in the HTTP request:

```shell
$ cat ./rules.json

[{
  "id": "some-id",
  "upstream": {
    "url": "http://my-backend-service"
  },
  "match": {
    "url": "http://my-app/some-route",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ]
  },
  "authenticators": [{
    "handler": "anonymous"
  }],
  "authorizer": { "handler": "allow" },
  "mutators": [{ "handler": "noop" }]
}]

$ curl -X GET http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 200 Status OK
The request has been allowed! The subject is: "anonymous"

$ curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer foobar" http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Status Unauthorized
The request is not authorized because credentials have been provided but only the anonymous
authenticator is enabled for this URL.
```

## `cookie_session`

The `cookie_session` authenticator will forward the request method, path and
headers to a session store. If the session store returns `200 OK` and body
`{ "subject": "...", "extra": {} }` then the authenticator will set the subject
appropriately.

### Configuration

- `check_session_url` (string, required) - The session store to forward request
  method/path/headers to for validation.
- `only` ([]string, optional) - If set, only requests that have at least one of
  the set cookies will be forwarded, others will be passed to the next
  authenticator. If unset, all requests are forwarded.
- `preserve_path` (boolean, optional) - If set, any path in `check_session_url`
  will be preserved instead of replacing the path with the path of the request
  being checked.
- `extra_from` (string, optional - defaults to `extra`) - A
  [GJSON Path](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md) pointing
  to the `extra` field. This defaults to `extra`, but it could also be `@this`
  (for the root element), `session.foo.bar` for
  `{ "subject": "...", "session": { "foo": {"bar": "whatever"} } }`, and so on.
- `subject_from` (string, optional - defaults to `subject`) - A
  [GJSON Path](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md) pointing
  to the `subject` field. This defaults to `subject`. Example: `identity.id` for
  `{ "identity": { "id": "1234" } }`.

```yaml
# Global configuration file oathkeeper.yml
authenticators:
  cookie_session:
    # Set enabled to true if the authenticator should be enabled and false to disable the authenticator. Defaults to false.
    enabled: true

    config:
      check_session_url: https://session-store-host
```

```yaml
# Some Access Rule: access-rule-1.yaml
id: access-rule-1
# match: ...
# upstream: ...
authenticators:
  - handler: cookie_session
    config:
      check_session_url: https://session-store-host
      only:
        - sessionid
```

```yaml
# Some Access Rule Preserving Path: access-rule-2.yaml
id: access-rule-2
# match: ...
# upstream: ...
authenticators:
  - handler: cookie_session
    config:
      check_session_url: https://session-store-host/check-session
      only:
        - sessionid
      preserve_path: true
```

### Access Rule Example

```shell
$ cat ./rules.json

[{
  "id": "some-id",
  "upstream": {
    "url": "http://my-backend-service"
  },
  "match": {
    "url": "http://my-app/some-route",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ]
  },
  "authenticators": [{
    "handler": "cookie_session"
  }],
  "authorizer": { "handler": "allow" },
  "mutators": [{ "handler": "noop" }]
}]

$ curl -X GET -b sessionid=abc http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
The request has been allowed! The subject is: "peter"

$ curl -X GET -b sessionid=def http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Status Unauthorized
The request is not authorized because the provided credentials are invalid.
```

## `oauth2_client_credentials`

This `oauth2_client_credentials` uses the username and password from HTTP Basic
Authorization (`Authorization: Basic base64(<username:password>)` to perform the
OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant in order to detect if the provided
credentials are valid.

This authenticator will use the username from the HTTP Basic Authorization
header as the subject for this request.

> If you are unfamiliar with OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials we recommend
> [reading this guide](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/).

### Configuration

- `token_url` (string, required) - The OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint that will be
  used to validate the client credentials.
- `required_scope` ([]string, optional) - Sets what scope is required by the URL
  and when making performing OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials request, the scope
  will be included in the request:

```yaml
# Global configuration file oathkeeper.yml
authenticators:
  oauth2_client_credentials:
    # Set enabled to true if the authenticator should be enabled and false to disable the authenticator. Defaults to false.
    enabled: true

    config:
      token_url: https://my-website.com/oauth2/token
```

```yaml
# Some Access Rule: access-rule-1.yaml
id: access-rule-1
# match: ...
# upstream: ...
authenticators:
  - handler: oauth2_client_credentials
    config:
      token_url: https://my-website.com/oauth2/token
```

### Access Rule Example

```shell
$ cat ./rules.json

[{
  "id": "some-id",
  "upstream": {
    "url": "http://my-backend-service"
  },
  "match": {
    "url": "http://my-app/some-route",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ]
  },
  "authenticators": [{
    "handler": "oauth2_client_credentials",
    "config": {
      "required_scope": ["scope-a", "scope-b"]
    }
  }],
  "authorizer": { "handler": "allow" },
  "mutators": [{ "handler": "noop" }]
}]

$ curl -X GET http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Status Unauthorized
The request is not authorized because no credentials have been provided.

$ curl -X GET --user idonotexist:whatever http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Status Unauthorized
The request is not authorized because the provided credentials are invalid.

$ curl -X GET --user peter:somesecret http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
The request has been allowed! The subject is: "peter"
```

In the background, a request to the OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint (value of
`authenticators.oauth2_client_credentials.token_url`) will be made, using the
OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant:

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=peter
&client_secret=somesecret
&scope=scope-a+scope-b
```

If the request succeeds, the credentials are considered valid and if the request
fails, the credentials are considered invalid.

## `oauth2_introspection`

The `oauth2_introspection` authenticator handles requests that have an Bearer
Token in the Authorization Header (`Authorization: bearer <token>`) or in a
different header or query parameter specified in configuration. It then uses
OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection to check if the token is valid and if the token
was granted the requested scope.

> If you are unfamiliar with OAuth 2.0 Introspection we recommend
> [reading this guide](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/token-introspection-endpoint/).

### Configuration

- `introspection_url` (string, required) - The OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection
  endpoint.
- `scope_strategy` (string, optional) - Sets the strategy to be used to
  validate/match the token scope. Supports "hierarchic", "exact", "wildcard",
  "none". Defaults to "none".
- `required_scope` ([]string, optional) - Sets what scope is required by the URL
  and when making performing OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials request, the scope
  will be included in the request
- `pre_authorization` (object, optional) - Enable pre-authorization in cases
  where the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection endpoint is protected by OAuth 2.0
  Bearer Tokens that can be retrieved using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
  grant.
  - `enabled` (bool, optional) - Enable pre-authorization. Defaults to false.
  - `client_id` (string, required if enabled) - The OAuth 2.0 Client ID to be
    used for the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant.
  - `client_secret` (string, required if enabled) - The OAuth 2.0 Client Secret
    to be used for the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant.
  - `token_url` (string, required if enabled) - The OAuth 2.0 Scope to be
    requested during the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant.
  - `scope` ([]string, optional) - The OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint where the OAuth
    2.0 Client Credentials Grant will be performed.
- `token_from` (object, optional) - The location of the bearer token. If not
  configured, the token will be received from a default location -
  'Authorization' header. One and only one location (header, query, or cookie)
  must be specified.
  - `header` (string, required, one of) - The header (case insensitive) that
    must contain a Bearer token for request authentication. It can't be set
    along with `query_parameter` or `cookie`.
  - `query_parameter` (string, required, one of) - The query parameter (case
    sensitive) that must contain a Bearer token for request authentication. It
    can't be set along with `header` or `cookie`.
  - `cookie` (string, required, one of) - The cookie (case sensitive) that must
    contain a Bearer token for request authentication. It can't be set along
    with `header` or `query_parameter`

  to the introspection request
- `cache` (object, optional) - Enables caching of incoming tokens
  - `enabled` (bool, optional) - Enable the cache, will use exp time of token to determine when to evict from cache. Defaults to false.
  - `ttl` (string) - Can override the default behaviour of using the token exp time, and specify a set time to live for the token in the cache.

### Access Rule Example

```shell
$ cat ./rules.json

[{
  "id": "some-id",
  "upstream": {
    "url": "http://my-backend-service"
  },
  "match": {
    "url": "http://my-app/some-route",
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ]
  },
  "authenticators": [{
    "handler": "oauth2_introspection",
    "config": {
      "required_scope": ["scope-a", "scope-b"]
    }
  }],
  "authorizer": { "handler": "allow" },
  "mutators": [{ "handler": "noop" }]
}]

$ curl -X GET http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Status Unauthorized
The request is not authorized because no credentials have been provided.

$ curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer invalid-token' http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 401 Status Unauthorized
The request is not authorized because the provided credentials are invalid.

$ curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer valid.access.token.from.peter' http://my-app/some-route

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
The request has been allowed! The subject is: "peter"
```

In the background, this handler will make a request to the OAuth 2.0 Token
Endpoint (configuration value
`authenticators.oauth2_introspection.introspection_url`) to check if the Bearer
Token is valid:

```
POST /oauth2/introspect HTTP/1.1

token=valid.access.token.from.peter
```

If pre-authorization is enabled, that request will include an Authorization
Header:

```
POST /oauth2/introspect HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer token-received-by-performing-pre-authorization

token=valid.access.token.from.peter
```

The Token is considered valid if the Introspection response is HTTP 200 OK and
includes `{"active":true}` in the response payload. The subject is extracted
from the `username` field.

## `jwt`

The `jwt` authenticator handles requests that have an Bearer Token in the
Authorization Header (`Authorization: bearer <token>`) or in a different header
or query parameter specified in configuration. It assumes that the token is a
JSON Web Token and tries to verify the signature of it.

### Configuration

- `jwks_urls` ([]string, required) - The URLs where ORY Oathkeeper can retrieve
  JSON Web Keys from for validating the JSON Web Token. Usually something like
  `https://my-keys.com/.well-known/jwks.json`. The response of that endpoint
  must return a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).
- `scope_strategy` (string, optional) - Sets the strategy to be used to
  validate/match the scope. Supports "hierarchic", "exact", "wildcard", "none".
  Defaults to "none".
- If `trusted_issuers` ([]string) is set, the JWT must contain a value for claim
  `iss` that matches _exactly_ (case-sensitive) one of the values of
  `trusted_issuers`. If no values are configured, the issuer will be ignored.
- If `target_audience` ([]string) is set, the JWT must contain all values
  (exact, case-sensitive) in the claim `aud`. If no values are configured, the
  audience will be ignored.
- Value `allowed_algorithms` ([]string) sets what signing algorithms are
  allowed. Defaults to `RS256`.
- Value `required_scope` ([]string) validates the scope of the JWT. It will
  checks for claims `scp`, `scope`, `scopes` in the JWT when validating the
  scope as that claim is not standardized.
- `token_from` (object, optional) - The location of the bearer token. If not
  configured, the token will be received from a default location -
  'Authorization' header. One and only one location (header, query, or cookie)
  must be specified.
  - `header` (string, required, one of) - The header (case insensitive) that
    must contain a Bearer token for request authentication. It can't be set
    along with `query_parameter` or `cookie`.
  - `query_parameter` (string, required, one of) - The query parameter (case
    sensitive) that must contain a Bearer token for request authentication. It
    can't be set along with `header` or `cookie`.
  - `cookie` (string, required, one of) - The cookie (case sensitive) that must
    contain a Bearer token for request authentication. It can't be set along
    with `header` or `query_parameter`

        # or
        # header: Custom-Authorization-Header
        # or
        # cookie: auth-token
```

#### Validation example

```json
{
  "handler": "jwt",
  "config": {
    "required_scope": ["scope-a", "scope-b"],
    "target_audience": [
      "https://my-service.com/api/users",
      "https://my-service.com/api/devices"
    ],
    "trusted_issuers": ["https://my-issuer.com/"],
    "allowed_algorithms": ["RS256", "RS256"]
  }
}
```

That exemplary Access Rule consider the following (decoded) JSON Web Token as
valid:

```
{
  "alg": "RS256"
}
{
  "iss": "https://my-issuer.com/",
  "aud": ["https://my-service.com/api/users", "https://my-service.com/api/devices"],
  "scp": ["scope-a", "scope-b"]
}
```

And this token as invalid (audience is missing, issuer is not matching, scope is
missing, wrong algorithm):

```
{
  "alg": "HS256"
}
{
  "iss": "https://not-my-issuer.com/",
  "aud": ["https://my-service.com/api/users"],
  "scp": ["not-scope-a", "scope-b"]
}
```

### Scope

JSON Web Tokens can be scoped. However, that feature is not standardized and
several claims that represent the token scope have been seen in the wild: `scp`,
`scope`, `scopes`. Additionally, the claim value can be a string (`"scope-a"`),
a space-delimited string (`"scope-a scope-b"`) or a JSON string array
(`["scope-a", "scope-b"]`). Because of this ambiguity, all of those claims are
checked and parsed and will be available as `scp` (string array) in the
authentication session (`.Extra["scp"]`).
