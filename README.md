ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision
API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. The BeyondCorp
Model is designed by [Google](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/) and secures
applications in Zero-Trust networks.

An Identity & Access Proxy is typically deployed in front of (think API Gateway)
web-facing applications and is capable of authenticating and optionally
authorizing access requests. The Access Control Decision API can be deployed
alongside an existing API Gateway or reverse proxy. ORY Oathkeeper's Access
Control Decision API works with:

- [Ambassador](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) via
  [auth service](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service).
- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) via the
  [External Authorization HTTP Filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http_filters/ext_authz_filter#config-http-filters-ext-authz)
- AWS API Gateway via
  [Custom Authorizers](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway/)
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) via
  [Authentication Based on Subrequest Result](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/)

among others.

This service is stable, but under active development and may introduce breaking
changes in future releases. Any breaking change will have extensive
documentation and upgrade instructions.

## Installation

Head over to the
[ORY Developer Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper/install) to
learn how to install ORY Oathkeeper on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker and how
to build ORY Oathkeeper from source.

## Ecosystem

<a href="https://console.ory.sh/">
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="docs/images/sec-console.png" alt="ORY Security Console">
</a>

### ORY Security Console: Administrative User Interface

The [ORY Security Console](https://console.ory.sh/) is a visual admin interface
for managing ORY Hydra, ORY Oathkeeper, and ORY Keto.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) ORY Hydra is a hardened OAuth2 and
OpenID Connect server optimized for low-latency, high throughput, and low
resource consumption. ORY Hydra is not an identity provider (user sign up, user
log in, password reset flow), but connects to your existing identity provider
through a consent app.

### ORY Keto: Access Control Policies as a Server

[ORY Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is a policy decision point. It uses a
set of access control policies, similar to AWS IAM Policies, in order to
determine whether a subject (user, application, service, car, ...) is authorized
to perform a certain action on a resource.

### Examples

The [ory/examples](https://github.com/ory/examples) repository contains numerous
examples of setting up this project individually and together with other
services from the ORY Ecosystem.
