ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of rules. The BeyondCorp
Model is designed by [Google](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/) and secures applications in Zero-Trust networks.
An Identity & Access Proxy is typically deployed in front of (think API Gateway) web-facing applications and is capable
of authenticating and optionally authorizing access requests.

ORY Oathkeeper is a reverse proxy which evaluates incoming HTTP requests based on a set of rules that are defined
by administartive users. ORY Oathkeeper is thus capable of:

* Identifying the user and providing the user session to API backends.
* Restricting access to certain resources based on a set of rules (Authorization).

This service is under active development and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.

## Installation

The easiest way to install ORY Oathkeeper is using the [Docker Hub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/oathkeeper/):

```

```

## Ecosystem

    <img align="right" width="30%" src="docs/images/sec-console.png" alt="ORY Security Console">
</a>

### ORY Security Console: Administrative User Interface

The [ORY Security Console](https://console.ory.am/auth/login) is a visual admin interface for managing ORY Hydra,
ORY Oathkeeper, and ORY Keto.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) ORY Hydra is a hardened OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server optimized
for low-latency, high throughput, and low resource consumption. ORY Hydra is not an identity provider
(user sign up, user log in, password reset flow), but connects to your existing identity provider through a consent app.

### ORY Keto: Access Control Policies as a Server

[ORY Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is a policy decision point. It uses a set of access control policies, similar
to AWS IAM Policies, in order to determine whether a subject (user, application, service, car, ...) is authorized to
perform a certain action on a resource.

### Develop

Developing with ORY Hydra is as easy as:

```
go get -d -u github.com/ory/oathkeeper
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory/oathkeeper
dep ensure
go test ./...
```

Then run it with in-memory database:

```
DATABASE_URL=memory go run main.go serve all
```
