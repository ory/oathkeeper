ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision
API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. The BeyondCorp
Model is designed by [Google](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/) and secures
applications in Zero-Trust networks.

An Identity & Access Proxy is typically deployed in front of (think API Gateway)
web-facing applications and is capable of authenticating and optionally
authorizing access requests. The Access Control Decision API can be deployed
alongside an existing API Gateway or reverse proxy. ORY Oathkeeper's Access
Control Decision API works with:

- [Ambassador](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) via
  [auth service](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service).
- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) via the
  [External Authorization HTTP Filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter)
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) via
  [Custom Authorizers](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway/)
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) via
  [Authentication Based on Subrequest Result](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/)

among others.

This service is stable, but under active development and may introduce breaking
changes in future releases. Any breaking change will have extensive
documentation and upgrade instructions.

## Ecosystem

<!--BEGIN ECOSYSTEM-->

We build Ory on several guiding principles when it comes to our architecture
design:

- Minimal dependencies
- Runs everywhere
- Scales without effort
- Minimize room for human and network errors

ORY's architecture designed to run best on a Container Orchestration Systems
such as Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, OpenShift, and similar projects. Binaries are
small (5-15MB) and available for all popular processor types (ARM, AMD64, i386)
and operating systems (FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Windows) without system
dependencies (Java, Node, Ruby, libxml, ...).

### ORY Kratos: Identity and User Infrastructure and Management

[ORY Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is an API-first Identity and User
Management system that is built according to
[cloud architecture best practices](https://www.ory.sh/docs/next/ecosystem/software-architecture-philosophy).
It implements core use cases that almost every software application needs to
deal with: Self-service Login and Registration, Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA/2FA), Account Recovery and Verification, Profile and Account Management.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) is an OpenID Certified™ OAuth2 and
OpenID Connect Provider can connect to any existing identity database (LDAP, AD,
KeyCloak, PHP+MySQL, ...) and user interface.

### ORY Oathkeeper: Identity & Access Proxy

[ORY Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a BeyondCorp/Zero Trust
Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) with configurable authentication, authorization,
and request mutation rules for your web services: Authenticate JWT, Access
Tokens, API Keys, mTLS; Check if the contained subject is allowed to perform the
request; Encode resulting content into custom headers (`X-User-ID`), JSON Web
Tokens and more!

### ORY Keto: Access Control Policies as a Server

[ORY Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is a policy decision point. It uses a
set of access control policies, similar to AWS IAM Policies, in order to
determine whether a subject (user, application, service, car, ...) is authorized
to perform a certain action on a resource.
